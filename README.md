01/06/2025: This is an early demo build of a staffing website; I've got the functionality done & will proceed with an FAQ's page & styling; This application will take in user information & pass that info to firebase (the backend database service I'm using for this project); The client can then use that information for background checks & the like; I've used environment vars to keep sensetive information hidden from the users; I will be updating this application over the next few weeks as this is only a rough draft in order to ensure functionality;
