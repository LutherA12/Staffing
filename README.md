01/06/2025: This is an early demo build of a staffing website; I've got the functionality done & will proceed with an FAQ's page & styling; This application will take in user information & pass that info to firebase (the backend database service I'm using for this project); The client can then use that information for background checks & the like; I've used environment vars in this project; I will be updating this application over the next few weeks as this is only a rough draft in order to ensure functionality;

01/06/2025: Another update for today, I've added quite a bit more & figured out my .env issue; I'm now faced with a new problem on how to upload checkbox data to my database; All other information uploads without issue, but the checkboxes don't follow the same rules; I'm going to do some research over the next few days, but I will see if I can figure it out tonight;

01/08/2025: I've solved it! Instead of using checkboxes I've decided to use dropdown menus since I can incorporate that state into my current upload function for firebase; I've also done a lot of codebase maintenance & I've moved some of the more repetitive code into their own components; I'm now passing the values & events (state) via props down to those corresponding components in order to try & maintain consistency & reusability within my codebase; On a minor note I've wrapped the submit button in a Link tag but it will not go to my thankyou page when pushed; I've checked in the dev tools & the route is correct & works so I'm currently unsure what the issue is, it's something I will look into tomorrow; I've also added an FAQ's page for immediate user friendly support;

01/09/2025: Another issue solved! I've initiated the useNavigate hook in order to send the user to the thank you page after form submission; I've also moved some of the divs & basic styles around to more closly match the components they reside in; I'm going to work on the thank you page next & then full styling comes last;
