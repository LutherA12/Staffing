01/06/2025: This is an early demo build of a staffing website; I've got the functionality done & will proceed with an FAQ's page & styling; This application will take in user information & pass that info to firebase (the backend database service I'm using for this project); The client can then use that information for background checks & the like; I've used environment vars in this project; I will be updating this application over the next few weeks as this is only a rough draft in order to ensure functionality;
01/06/2025: Another update for today, I've added quite a bit more & figured out my .env issue; I'm now faced with a new problem on how to upload checkbox data to my database; All other information uploads without issue, but the checkboxes don't follow the same rules; I'm going to do some research over the next few days, but I will see if I can figure it out tonight;
